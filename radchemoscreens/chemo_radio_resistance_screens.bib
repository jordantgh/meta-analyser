  abstract = {Glioblastoma is the most fatal of all primary human brain tumors with 14 months median survival. The mainstay therapy for this tumor involves temozolomide, surgery, radiotherapy and tumor treating electric field. Cancer resistance to commonly available chemotherapeutics remains a major challenge in glioblastoma patients receiving treatment and unfavorably impact their overall survival and outcome. However, the lack of progress in this area could be attributed to lack of tools to probe unbiasedly at the genome wide level the coding and non-coding elements contribution on a large scale for factors that control resistance to chemotherapeutics. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapeutics will enable precision medicine in the treatment of cancer patients., CRISPR Cas9a has emerged as a functional genomics tool to study at genome level the factors that control cancer resistance to drugs. Recently, we used genome wide CRISPR-Cas9a screen to identify genes responsible for glioblastoma susceptibility to etoposide. We extended our inquiry to understand genes that control glioblastoma response to temozolomide by using genome scale CRISPR. This study shows that the unbiased genome-wide loss of function approach can be applied to discover genes that influence tumor resistance to chemotherapeutics and contribute to chemoresistance in glioblastoma.},

We and others had shown that a subset of glioblastomas (GBM), the most malignant of all primary brain tumors in adults, are responsive to TOP2 poisons. To identify genes that confer susceptibility to this drug in gliomas, we performed a genome-scale CRISPR knockout screen with etoposide. Genes involved in protein synthesis and DNA damage were implicated in etoposide susceptibility. To define potential biomarkers for TOP2 poisons, CRISPR hits were overlapped with genes whose expression correlates with susceptibility to this drug across glioma cell lines, revealing ribosomal protein subunit RPS11, 16, 18 as putative biomarkers for response to TOP2 poisons. Loss of RPS11 led to resistance to etoposide and doxorubicin and impaired the induction of pro-apoptotic gene APAF1 following treatment. The expression of these ribosomal subunits was also associated with susceptibility to TOP2 poisons across cell lines from gliomas and multiple other cancers.},

To explore genetic resistance mechanisms, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens in cells treated with the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan. Thus, we here establish that inactivating terminal components of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) machinery or of the BRCA1-A complex specifically confer topotecan resistance to ATM-deficient cells. We show that hypersensitivity of ATM-mutant cells to topotecan or the poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib reflects delayed engagement of homologous recombination at DNA-replication-fork associated single-ended double-strand breaks (DSBs), allowing some to be subject to toxic NHEJ. Preventing DSB ligation by NHEJ, or enhancing homologous recombination by BRCA1-A complex disruption, suppresses this toxicity, highlighting a crucial role for ATM in preventing toxic LIG4-mediated chromosome fusions. Notably, suppressor mutations in ATM-mutant backgrounds are different to those in BRCA1-mutant scenarios, suggesting new opportunities for patient stratification and additional therapeutic vulnerabilities for clinical exploitation., Mutations in the ATM tumor suppressor gene confer hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents. Here, the authors provide evidence that these hypersensitivities reflect a crucial role for ATM at damaged replication forks being to prevent toxic DNA end-joining leading to chromosome fusions and cell death.},

In particular, APOBEC3A (A3A) has emerged as a major driver of mutagenesis in cancer cells, and its expression results in DNA damage and susceptibility to treatment with inhibitors of the ATR and CHK1 checkpoint kinases. Here, we report the implementation of CRISPR/Cas-9 genetic screening to identify susceptibilities of multiple A3A-expressing lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cell lines. We identify HMCES, a protein recently linked to the protection of abasic sites, as a central protein for the tolerance of A3A expression. HMCES depletion results in synthetic lethality with A3A expression preferentially in a TP53-mutant background. Analysis of previous screening data reveals a strong association between A3A mutational signatures and sensitivity to HMCES loss and indicates that HMCES is specialized in protecting against a narrow spectrum of DNA damaging agents in addition to A3A. We experimentally show that both HMCES disruption and A3A expression increase susceptibility of cancer cells to ionizing radiation (IR), oxidative stress, and ATR inhibition, strategies that are often applied in tumor therapies. Overall, our results suggest that HMCES is an attractive target for selective treatment of A3A-expressing tumors., APOBEC3A (A3A) cytosine deaminase activity causes DNA damage and drives cancer mutagenesis. A genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screen identifies HMCES, a suicide enzyme that binds abasic sites, as a major suppressor of A3A-mediated damage in non-small cell lung cancer.

ATM inhibitors may therefore sensitize cancer cells to these agents. Some cancers may also have underlying genetic defects predisposing them to an ATM inhibitor monotherapy response. We have conducted a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genetic vulnerabilities that sensitize lung cancer cells to ATM inhibitors. Knockout of genes in the Fanconi anemia (FA)/BRCA pathway results in hypersensitivity to the ATM inhibitor M3541. Knockdown of either an FA gene or of ATM results in reduced double-strand break end resection, enhanced non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair, and decreased homologous recombination repair. Knockout of both the FA/BRCA pathway and ATM strongly inhibits end resection and generates toxic levels of NHEJ, thereby elucidating a mechanism of cellular death by synthetic lethality. ATM inhibitors may therefore be useful for the treatment of tumors with a defective FA/BRCA pathway., ATM inhibitors are currently in clinical development as anti-cancer agents. Using a genome-wide CRISPR screen, Cai et al. demonstrate that cancer cells with Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway deficiency are sensitive to ATM inhibition.

  abstract = {Introduction Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is a promising anticancer drug for hematological malignancy. Given the dramatic efficacy of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), ATO has been utilized in other types of cancers, including solid tumors. Unfortunately, the results were not comparable with the effects on APL, and the resistance mechanism has not been clarified yet. This study intends to identify relevant genes and pathways affecting ATO drug sensitivity through genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown screening to provide a panoramic view for further study of ATO targets and improved clinical outcomes. Methods A genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown screening system was constructed for ATO screening. The screening results were processed with MAGeCK, and the results were subjected to pathway enrichment analysis using WebGestalt and KOBAS. We also performed protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis using String and Cytoscape, followed by expression profiling and survival curve analysis of critical genes. Virtual screening was used to recognize drugs that may interact with the hub gene. Results We applied enrichment analysis and identified vital ATO-related pathways such as metabolism, chemokines and cytokines production and signaling, and immune system responses. In addition, we identified KEAP1 as the top gene relating to ATO resistance. We found that KEAP1 expression was higher in the pan-cancer, including ALL, than in normal tissue. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with higher KEAP1 expression had worse overall survival (OS). A virtual screen showed that etoposide and eltrombopag could bind to KEAP1 and potentially interact with ATO. Discussion ATO is a multi-target anticancer drug, and the key pathways regulating its sensitivity include oxidative stress, metabolism, chemokines and cytokines, and the immune system. KEAP1 is the most critical gene regulating ATO drug sensitivity, which is related to AML prognosis and may bind to some clinical drugs leading to an interaction with ATO. These integrated results provided new insights into the pharmacological mechanism of ATO and potentiate for further applications in cancer treatments.},

Silencing CDC7 in chemo-resistant SCLC cells decreased the IC50 and improved the efficacy of chemotherapy. Based on the highest single agent model, the CDC7 inhibitor XL413 had a synergistic effect with both cisplatin and etoposide in chemo-resistant SCLC cells, but had no such effect in chemo-sensitive SCLC cells; the combination of XL413 and chemotherapy significantly inhibited cell growth. Western blot and flow cytometry showed that the combined treatments increased apoptosis, whereas XL413 alone had little effect on apoptosis. An analysis of cell cycle and cyclin protein levels indicated that the combination of XL413 and chemotherapy-induced G1/S phase arrest and DNA damage in chemo-resistant SCLC cells. Xenografted tumor and histoculture drug response assays using patient-derived xenografts showed that XL413 improved the efficacy of chemotherapy in vivo and with SCLC tissues.

  abstract = {Background Type II testicular germ cell tumours (TGCT) are the most prevalent tumours in young men. Patients suffering from cisplatin-resistant TGCTs are facing very poor prognosis demanding novel therapeutic options. Neddylation is a known posttranslational modification mediating many important biological processes, including tumorigenesis. Overactivation of the neddylation pathway promotes carcinogenesis and tumour progression in various entities by inducing proteasomal degradation of tumour suppressors (e.g., p21, p27). Methods We used a genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 activation screen to identify cisplatin resistance factors. TGCT cell lines were treated with the neddylation inhibitor (MLN4924)/cisplatin/combination and investigated for changes in viability (XTT assay), apoptosis/cell cycle (flow cytometry) as well as in the transcriptome (3'mRNA sequencing). Results NAE1 overexpression was detected in cisplatin-resistant colonies from the CRISPR screen. Inhibition of neddylation using MLN4924 increased cisplatin cytotoxicity in TGCT cell lines and sensitised cisplatin-resistant cells towards cisplatin. Apoptosis, G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest, {$\gamma$}H2A.X/P27 accumulation and mesoderm/endoderm differentiation were observed in TGCT cells, while fibroblast cells were unaffected. Conclusions We identified overactivation of neddylation as a factor for cisplatin resistance in TGCTs and highlighted the additive effect of NAE1 inhibition by MLN4924 in combination with cisplatin as a novel treatment option for TGCTs.,},

Objective: To identify genes that influence cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer. Design, setting, and participants: We performed a whole-genome CRISPR screen in a bladder cancer cell line to identify genes that mediate resistance to cisplatin. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Targeted validation was performed in two bladder cancer cell lines. The top gene candidate was validated in a publicly available bladder cancer dataset. Results and limitations: From the CRISPR screen, we identified MSH2 as the most significantly enriched gene and mismatch repair as the most significantly enriched pathway that promoted resistance to cisplatin. Bladder cancer cells with knockdown of MSH2 showed a reduction in cisplatin-mediated apoptosis. MSH2 loss did not impact the sensitivity to other chemotherapies, including the cisplatin analog oxaliplatin. Bladder tumors with low MSH2 protein levels, quantified using reverse-phase protein array, showed poorer survival when treated with cisplatin- or carboplatin-based therapy; these results require future validation using immunohistochemistry. Additionally, results are retrospective from patients with primarily high-grade tumors; thus, validation in a controlled clinical trial is needed. Conclusions: We generated in vitro evidence that bladder cancer cell lines depleted of MSH2 are more resistant to cisplatin. We additionally found an association between low MSH2 in bladder tumors and poorer patient survival when treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. If successfully validated prospectively, MSH2 protein level could assist in the selection of patients for chemotherapy. Patient summary: We report the first evidence that MSH2 protein level may contribute to chemotherapy resistance observed in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. MSH2 has potential as a biomarker predictive of response to platinum-based therapy.},

Here through a loss-of-function CRISPR screen we identify DYNLL1 as an inhibitor of DNA end resection. Loss of DYNLL1 allows DNA end resection and restores HR in BRCA1-mutant cells, thereby inducing resistance to platinum drugs and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Low BRCA1 expression correlates with increased chromosomal aberrations in primary ovarian carcinomas, and the junction sequences of somatic structural variants indicate diminished HR. Concurrent decrease in DYNLL1 expression in BRCA1 low carcinomas reduced genomic alterations and increased homology at lesions. In cells DYNLL1 limits nucleolytic degradation of DNA ends by associating with the DNA end resection machinery (MRN complex, BLM helicase and DNA2). In vitro, DYNLL1 directly binds MRE11 to limit its end resection activity. Therefore, we infer that DYNLL1 is an important anti-resection factor that significantly influences genomic stability and response to DNA damaging chemotherapy.},

  abstract = {Simple Summary Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in Western countries. Although several therapeutic strategies have been developed for pancreatic cancer, radiation therapy has not yet yielded satisfactory results. Unraveling the mechanism of radioresistance in pancreatic cancer and developing new therapeutic targets has become a major challenge. Therefore, we applied kinome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screening combined with the 3D cell culture method and identified DYRK1A as a sensitive target for radiotherapy. Additionally, we confirmed that DYRK1A-targeted inhibitors could enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy. Our results further support the use of CRISPR-Cas9 screening to identify novel therapeutic targets and develop new strategies to enhance radiotherapy efficacy in pancreatic cancer. Abstract Although radiation therapy has recently made great advances in cancer treatment, the majority of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (PC) cannot achieve satisfactory outcomes due to intrinsic and acquired radioresistance. Identifying the molecular mechanisms that impair the efficacy of radiotherapy and targeting these pathways are essential to improve the radiation response of PC patients. Our goal is to identify sensitive targets for pancreatic cancer radiotherapy (RT) using the kinome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen and enhance the therapeutic effect through the development and application of targeted inhibitors combined with radiotherapy. We transduced pancreatic cancer cells with a protein kinase library; 2D and 3D library cells were irradiated daily with a single dose of up to 2 Gy for 4 weeks for a total of 40 Gy using an X-ray generator. Sufficient DNA was collected for next-generation deep sequencing to identify candidate genes. In this study, we identified several cell cycle checkpoint kinases and DNA damage related kinases in 2D- and 3D-cultivated cells, including DYRK1A, whose loss of function sensitizes cells to radiotherapy. Additionally, we demonstrated that the harmine-targeted suppression of DYRK1A used in conjunction with radiotherapy increases DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and impairs homologous repair (HR), resulting in more cancer cell death. Our results support the use of CRISPR-Cas9 screening to identify new therapeutic targets, develop radiosensitizers, and provide novel strategies for overcoming the tolerance of pancreatic cancer to radiotherapy.},

  abstract = {Chemotherapy can eradicate a majority of cancer cells. However, a small population of tumor cells often survives drug treatments through genetic and/or non-genetic mechanisms, leading to tumor recurrence. Here we report a reversible chemoresistance phenotype regulated by the mTOR pathway. Through a genome-wide CRISPR knockout library screen in pancreatic cancer cells treated with chemotherapeutic agents, we have identified the mTOR pathway as a prominent determinant of chemosensitivity. Pharmacological suppression of mTOR activity in cancer cells from diverse tissue origins leads to the persistence of a reversibly resistant population, which is otherwise eliminated by chemotherapeutic agents. Conversely, activation of the mTOR pathway increases chemosensitivity in vitro and in vivo and predicts better survival among various human cancers. Persister cells display a senescence phenotype. Inhibition of mTOR does not induce cellular senescence per se, but rather promotes the survival of senescent cells through regulation of autophagy and G2/M cell cycle arrest, as revealed by a small-molecule chemical library screen. Thus, mTOR plays a causal yet paradoxical role in regulating chemotherapeutic response; inhibition of the mTOR pathway, while suppressing tumor expansion, facilitates the development of a reversible drug-tolerant senescence state., Chemotherapy resistance poses a major obstacle in cancer therapy. Here, the authors identify the mTOR pathway as a determinant of chemosensitivity and demonstrate that inhibition of mTOR promotes the persistence of a chemotherapy-resistant cancer-cell subpopulation.},

  abstract = {TP53 mutations are common in most human cancers, but few therapeutic options for TP53-mutant tumors exist. To identify potential therapeutic options for cancer patients with TP53 mutations, we profiled 127 FDA approved chemotherapy drugs against human embryonic stem cells (hESC) in which we engineered TP53 deletion by genome editing. We identified twenty-seven cancer therapeutic drugs for which TP53 mutations conferred resistance; most of these drugs target DNA synthesis or topoisomerase and cause DNA damage. We then performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen in the TP53-null hESC in the presence and absence of sublethal concentrations of cisplatin and identified 137 genes whose loss selectively re-sensitized the p53-null cells to this chemotherapeutic agent. Gene ontology classification of the resensitizing loci revealed significant overrepresentation of spindle checkpoint pathway genes. Moreover, we confirmed that targeting ZNF207/BuGZ sensitizes p53-null hESC to cisplatin. These data indicate that targeted inhibition of spindle assembly checkpoints (SAC) and chromosomal organizing centers may provide a way to treat p53-deficient cancer cells with standard chemotherapy drugs. Development of small molecule inhibitors of spindle assembly checkpoint proteins may be a useful strategy for rescuing DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics in TP53 mutant cancers.},

We performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 synthetic-lethal screening to identify functional modulators of etoposide response in leukemic cell line and integrated results from CRISPR-screen with gene expression and clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with AML treated with etoposide-containing regimen. Our results confirmed the involvement of well-characterized genes, including TOP2A and ABCC1, as well as identified novel genes such as RAD54L2, PRKDC, and ZNF451 that have potential to be novel drug targets.

  abstract = {Background Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients suffer poor outcomes, including a five-year survival of below 10\%. Poor outcomes result in part from therapeutic resistance that limits the impact of cytotoxic first-line therapy. Novel therapeutic approaches are needed, but currently no targeted therapies exist to treat PDAC. Methods To assess cellular resistance mechanisms common to four cytotoxic chemotherapies (gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) used to treat PDAC patients, we performed four genome-wide CRISPR activation (CRISPRact) and CRISPR knock-out (CRISPRko) screens in two common PDAC cell lines (Panc-1 and BxPC3). We used pathway analysis to identify gene sets enriched among our hits and conducted RNA-sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) to characterize top hits from our screen. We used scratch assays to assess changes in cellular migration with HDAC1 overexpression. Results Our data revealed activation of ABCG2, a well-described efflux pump, as the most consistent mediator of resistance in each of our screens. CRISPR-mediated activation of genes involved in transcriptional co-repressor complexes also conferred resistance to multiple drugs. Expression of many of these genes, including HDAC1, is associated with reduced survival in PDAC patients. Up-regulation of HDAC1 in vitro increased promoter occupancy and expression of several genes involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These cells also displayed phenotypic changes in cellular migration consistent with activation of the EMT pathway. The expression changes resulting from HDAC1 activation were also observed with activation of several other co-repressor complex members. Finally, we developed a publicly available analysis tool, PancDS, which integrates gene expression profiles with our screen results to predict drug sensitivity in resected PDAC tumors and cell lines. Conclusion Our results provide a comprehensive resource for identifying cellular mechanisms of drug resistance in PDAC, mechanistically implicate HDAC1, and co-repressor complex members broadly, in multi-drug resistance, and provide an analytical tool for predicting treatment response in PDAC tumors and cell lines.

Temozolomide (TMZ) is one of these options, however, with limited success, and failure is mainly due to tumor resistance. In this work, genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 lentiviral screen libraries for gene knockout or activation were transduced in the human glioblastoma cell line, aiming to identify genes that modulate TMZ resistance. The sgRNAs enriched in both libraries in surviving cells after TMZ treatment were identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Pathway analyses of gene candidates on knockout screening revealed several enriched pathways, including the mismatch repair and the Sonic Hedgehog pathways. Silencing three genes ranked on the top 10 list (MSH2, PTCH2, and CLCA2) confirm cell protection from TMZ-induced death. In addition, a CRISPR activation library revealed that NRF2 and Wnt pathways are involved in TMZ resistance. Consistently, overexpression of FZD6, CTNNB1, or NRF2 genes significantly increased cell survival upon TMZ treatment. Moreover, NRF2 and related genes detected in this screen presented a robust negative correlation with glioblastoma patient survival rates. Finally, several gene candidates from knockout or activation screening are targetable by inhibitors or small molecules, and some of them have already been used in the clinic.},

Through bioinformatics and genome-wide CRISPR screens, we here reveal that FBXW7 deficiency leads to multidrug resistance (MDR). Proteomic analyses found an upregulation of mitochondrial factors as a hallmark of FBXW7 deficiency, which has been previously linked to chemotherapy resistance. Despite this increased expression of mitochondrial factors, functional analyses revealed that mitochondria are under stress, and genetic or chemical targeting of mitochondria is preferentially toxic for FBXW7-deficient cells. Mechanistically, the toxicity of therapies targeting mitochondrial translation such as the antibiotic tigecycline relates to the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) in a GCN2 kinase-dependent manner. Furthermore, the discovery of additional drugs that are toxic for FBXW7-deficient cells showed that all of them unexpectedly activate a GCN2-dependent ISR regardless of their accepted mechanism of action. Our study reveals that while one of the most frequent mutations in cancer reduces the sensitivity to the vast majority of available therapies, it renders cells vulnerable to ISR-activating drugs., FBXW7 mutations are among the most frequent in cancer.

Furthermore, the 15-gene classifier is significantly associated with patient responsiveness to NACT in both univariate (odds ratio, 10.8; 95\% CI, 3.55\textendash 32.86; p = 2.8 \texttimes{} 10-5) and multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 17.34; 95\% CI, 4.04\textendash 74.40; p = 1.23 \texttimes{} 10-4) in the validation set. In conclusion, the 15-gene classifier can accurately predict the clinical response to NACT before treatment, representing a promising approach for guiding the selection of appropriate treatment strategies for locally advanced cervical cancer., In a multicenter study of 158 patients with stage IB-IIB cervical cancer, a 15-core-gene classifier is developed by integrated analysis of whole-exome sequencing and CRISPR library screening. By predicting cervical cancer patients who would benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the classifier has the potential to guide the proper selection of treatment modalities, implicating a significant advance toward individualizing therapy.},

  abstract = {KLF11 is a negative regulator of CSC stemness in sarcoma by repressing YAP/TEAD-dependent transcription., Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are involved in tumorigenesis, recurrence, and therapy resistance. To identify critical regulators of sarcoma CSCs, we performed a reporter-based genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen and uncovered Kruppel-like factor 11 (KLF11) as top candidate. In vitro and in vivo functional annotation defined a negative role of KLF11 in CSCs. Mechanistically, KLF11 and YAP/TEAD bound to adjacent DNA sites along with direct interaction. KLF11 recruited SIN3A/HDAC to suppress the transcriptional output of YAP/TEAD, which, in turn, promoted KLF11 transcription, forming a negative feedback loop. However, in CSCs, this negative feedback was lost because of epigenetic silence of KLF11, causing sustained YAP activation. Low KLF11 was associated with poor prognosis and chemotherapy response in patients with sarcoma. Pharmacological activation of KLF11 by thiazolidinedione effectively restored chemotherapy response. Collectively, our study identifies KLF11 as a negative regulator in sarcoma CSCs and potential therapeutic target.},

  abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal cancers to treat. Existing drugs rarely work as a single agent. Therefore, identifying novel drug combinations that will synergistically and selectively kill PDAC cells is a significant unmet need. Here, we used CRISPR gene knockout screening to identify combinatorial targets of gemcitabine (Gem) in PDAC. We discovered that PRMT5 depletion makes PDAC cells significantly sensitive to Gem. Our mechanistic findings show that PRMT5 inhibition impairs DNA repair mechanism. Hence the combination results in synergistic accumulation of Gem-induced DNA damage. We show that the combination leads to synergistic cell death in PDAC cells in vitro and in vivo., Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most challenging cancers to treat. Due to the asymptomatic nature of the disease and lack of curative treatment modalities, the 5-y survival rate of PDAC patients is one of the lowest of any cancer type. The recurrent genetic alterations in PDAC are yet to be targeted. Therefore, identification of effective drug combinations is desperately needed. Here, we performed an in vivo CRISPR screen in an orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model to identify gene targets whose inhibition creates synergistic tumor growth inhibition with gemcitabine (Gem), a first- or second-line chemotherapeutic agent for PDAC treatment. The approach revealed protein arginine methyltransferase gene 5 (PRMT5) as an effective druggable candidate whose inhibition creates synergistic vulnerability of PDAC cells to Gem. Genetic depletion and pharmacological inhibition indicate that loss of PRMT5 activity synergistically enhances Gem cytotoxicity due to the accumulation of excessive DNA damage. At the molecular level, we show that inhibition of PRMT5 results in RPA depletion and impaired homology-directed DNA repair (HDR) activity. The combination (Gem + PRMT5 inhibition) creates conditional lethality and synergistic reduction of PDAC tumors in vivo. The findings demonstrate that unbiased genetic screenings combined with a clinically relevant model system is a practical approach in identifying synthetic lethal drug combinations for cancer treatment.},

By performing genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 library knockdown screening, we found that mitochondrial elongation factor 2 (MIEF2) was among the top candidate genes. The OXL-resistant cell lines and organoids developed in the present study showed stable but low expression of MIEF2. Reduced MIEF2 expression may enhance CRC resistance to OXL by reducing mitochondrial stability and inhibiting apoptosis by decreasing cytochrome C release. In conclusion, among the different biomarkers of OXL resistance in CRC, MIEF2 may serve as a specific biomarker of OXL responsiveness and a potential target for the development of therapies to improve chemotherapeutic effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Gemcitabine is the first-line treatment for locally advanced and metastatic gallbladder cancer (GBC), but poor gemcitabine response is universal. Here, we utilize a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify that loss of ELP5 reduces the gemcitabine-induced apoptosis in GBC cells in a P53-dependent manner through the Elongator complex and other uridine 34 (U34) tRNA-modifying enzymes. Mechanistically, loss of ELP5 impairs the integrity and stability of the Elongator complex to abrogate wobble U34 tRNA modification, and directly impedes the wobble U34 modification-dependent translation of hnRNPQ mRNA, a validated P53 internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) trans-acting factor. Downregulated hnRNPQ is unable to drive P53 IRES-dependent translation, but rescuing a U34 modification-independent hnRNPQ mutant could restore P53 translation and gemcitabine sensitivity in ELP5-depleted GBC cells. GBC patients with lower ELP5, hnRNPQ, or P53 expression have poor survival outcomes after gemcitabine chemotherapy. These results indicate that the Elongator/hnRNPQ/P53 axis controls gemcitabine sensitivity in GBC cells., Gemcitabine is used to treat gallbaldder cancer but patient responses are variable.

  abstract = {Simple Summary Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers. Although complete surgical resection is the only curative treatment for pancreatic cancer, a late diagnosis is common and makes surgical treatment infeasible. Therefore, most patients receive chemotherapy to reduce the tumor burden. Gemcitabine has been the main chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer for over a decade; however, chemoresistance has emerged as a significant challenge to the efficacy of chemotherapy. In this study, we applied genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function screening with gemcitabine treatment to identify DCK and CCNL1 as genes that contribute to gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer and explored the mechanism of CCNL1-related gemcitabine resistance. Abstract Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers. Due to the difficulty of early diagnosis, most patients are diagnosed with metastasis or advanced-stage cancer, limiting the possibility of surgical treatment. Therefore, chemotherapy is applied to improve patient outcomes, and gemcitabine has been the primary chemotherapy drug for pancreatic cancer for over a decade. However, drug resistance poses a significant challenge to the efficacy of chemotherapy. The CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) gene-editing system is a powerful tool, and researchers have developed CRISPR/Cas9 library screening as a means to identify the genes associated with specific phenotype changes. We performed genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening in the mouse pancreatic cancer cell line TB32047 with gemcitabine treatment and identified deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) and cyclin L1 (CCNL1) as the top hits. We knocked out DCK and CCNL1 in the TB32047 and PANC1 cell lines and confirmed that the loss of DCK or CCNL1 enhanced gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cells. Many researchers have addressed the mechanism of DCK-related gemcitabine resistance; however, no study has focused on CCNL1 and gemcitabine resistance. Therefore, we explored the mechanism of CCNL1-related gemcitabine resistance and found that the loss of CCNL1 activates the ERK/AKT/STAT3 survival pathway, causing cell resistance to gemcitabine treatment.},

In genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis and interference screens in mitotic cells, depletion of PSMC3IP or MND1 causes sensitivity to poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) used in cancer treatment. PSMC3IP or MND1 depletion also causes ionizing radiation sensitivity. These effects are independent of PSMC3IP/MND1's role in mitotic alternative lengthening of telomeres. PSMC3IP- or MND1-depleted cells accumulate toxic RAD51 foci in response to DNA damage, show impaired homology-directed DNA repair, and become PARPi sensitive, even in cells lacking both BRCA1 and TP53BP1. Epistasis between PSMC3IP-MND1 and BRCA1/BRCA2 defects suggest that abrogated D loop formation is the cause of PARPi sensitivity. Wild-type PSMC3IP reverses PARPi sensitivity, whereas a PSMC3IP p.Glu201del mutant associated with D loop defects and ovarian dysgenesis does not. These observations suggest that meiotic proteins such as MND1 and PSMC3IP have a greater role in mitotic DNA repair.},

  abstract = {Glioblastomas (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor, and radiotherapy plays a critical role in its therapeutic management. Unfortunately, the development of radioresistance is universal. Here, we identified calcium-regulated heat-stable protein 1 (CARHSP1) as a critical driver for radioresistance utilizing genome-wide CRISPR activation screening. This is a protein with a cold-shock domain (CSD)-containing that is highly similar to cold-shock proteins. CARHSP1 mRNA level was upregulated in irradiation-resistant GBM cells and knockdown of CARHSP1 sensitized GBM cells to radiotherapy. The high expression of CARHSP1 upon radiation might mediate radioresistance by activating the inflammatory signaling pathway. More importantly, patients with high levels of CARHSP1 had poorer survival when treated with radiotherapy. Collectively, our findings suggested that targeting the CARHSP1/TNF-{$\alpha$} inflammatory signaling activation induced by radiotherapy might directly affect radioresistance and present an attractive therapeutic target for GBM, particularly for patients with high levels of CARHSP1.},
