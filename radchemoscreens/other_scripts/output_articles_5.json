        "Abstract": "Whole chromosome losses resulting in near-haploid karyotypes are found in a rare subgroup of treatment-refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. To systematically dissect the unique physiology and uncover susceptibilities that can be exploited in near-haploid leukemia, we leveraged single-cell RNA-Seq and computational inference of cell cycle stages to pinpoint key differences between near-haploid and diploid leukemia cells. Combining cell cycle stage-specific differential expression with gene essentiality scores from a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout screen, we identified the homologous recombination pathway component RAD51B as an essential gene in near-haploid leukemia. DNA damage analyses revealed significantly increased sensitivity of RAD51-mediated repair to RAD51B loss in the G2/M stage of near-haploid cells, suggesting a unique role of RAD51B in the homologous recombination pathway. Elevated G2/M and G1/S checkpoint signaling was part of a RAD51B signature expression program in response to chemotherapy in a xenograft model of human near-haploid B-ALL, and RAD51B and its associated programs were overexpressed in a large panel of near-haploid B-ALL patients. These data highlight a unique genetic dependency on DNA repair machinery in near-haploid leukemia and demarcate RAD51B as a promising candidate for targeted therapy in this treatment-resistant disease."

        "Abstract": "Type II testicular germ cell tumours (TGCT) are the most prevalent tumours in young men. Patients suffering from cisplatin-resistant TGCTs are facing very poor prognosis demanding novel therapeutic options. Neddylation is a known posttranslational modification mediating many important biological processes, including tumorigenesis. Overactivation of the neddylation pathway promotes carcinogenesis and tumour progression in various entities by inducing proteasomal degradation of tumour suppressors (e.g., p21, p27). We used a genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 activation screen to identify cisplatin resistance factors. TGCT cell lines were treated with the neddylation inhibitor (MLN4924)/cisplatin/combination and investigated for changes in viability (XTT assay), apoptosis/cell cycle (flow cytometry) as well as in the transcriptome (3'mRNA sequencing). NAE1 overexpression was detected in cisplatin-resistant colonies from the CRISPR screen. Inhibition of neddylation using MLN4924 increased cisplatin cytotoxicity in TGCT cell lines and sensitised cisplatin-resistant cells towards cisplatin. Apoptosis, G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest, \u03b3H2A.X/P27 accumulation and mesoderm/endoderm differentiation were observed in TGCT cells, while fibroblast cells were unaffected. We identified overactivation of neddylation as a factor for cisplatin resistance in TGCTs and highlighted the additive effect of NAE1 inhibition by MLN4924 in combination with cisplatin as a novel treatment option for TGCTs."

        "Abstract": "Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is a promising anticancer drug for hematological malignancy. Given the dramatic efficacy of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), ATO has been utilized in other types of cancers, including solid tumors. Unfortunately, the results were not comparable with the effects on APL, and the resistance mechanism has not been clarified yet. This study intends to identify relevant genes and pathways affecting ATO drug sensitivity through genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown screening to provide a panoramic view for further study of ATO targets and improved clinical outcomes. A genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown screening system was constructed for ATO screening. The screening results were processed with MAGeCK, and the results were subjected to pathway enrichment analysis using WebGestalt and KOBAS. We also performed protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis using String and Cytoscape, followed by expression profiling and survival curve analysis of critical genes. Virtual screening was used to recognize drugs that may interact with the hub gene. We applied enrichment analysis and identified vital ATO-related pathways such as metabolism, chemokines and cytokines production and signaling, and immune system responses. In addition, we identified KEAP1 as the top gene relating to ATO resistance. We found that KEAP1 expression was higher in the pan-cancer, including ALL, than in normal tissue. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with higher KEAP1 expression had worse overall survival (OS). A virtual screen showed that etoposide and eltrombopag could bind to KEAP1 and potentially interact with ATO. ATO is a multi-target anticancer drug, and the key pathways regulating its sensitivity include oxidative stress, metabolism, chemokines and cytokines, and the immune system. KEAP1 is the most critical gene regulating ATO drug sensitivity, which is related to AML prognosis and may bind to some clinical drugs leading to an interaction with ATO. These integrated results provided new insights into the pharmacological mechanism of ATO and potentiate for further applications in cancer treatments."

To investigate the underlying tumor dynamics, we performed trajectory analysis on the single-nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) of chemoresistant tumor clones during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). It revealed a common tumor trajectory across multiple patients with HER2-like expansions during NAC. Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out on mammary epithelial cells revealed chemosensitivity-promoting knock-outs were up-regulated along the tumor trajectory. Furthermore, we derived a consensus gene signature of TNBC chemoresistance by comparing the trajectory transcriptome with chemoresistant transcriptomes from TNBC cell lines and poor prognosis patient samples to predict FDA-approved drugs, including afatinib (pan-HER inhibitor), targeting the consensus signature. We validated the synergistic efficacy of afatinib and paclitaxel in chemoresistant TNBC cells and confirmed pharmacological suppression of the consensus signature. The study provides a dynamic model of chemoresistant tumor transcriptome, and computational framework for pharmacological intervention."

        "Abstract": "Etoposide is used to treat a wide range of malignant cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in children. Despite the use of intensive chemotherapeutic regimens containing etoposide, a significant proportion of pediatric patients with AML become resistant to treatment and relapse, leading to poor survival. This poses a pressing clinical challenge to identify mechanisms underlying drug resistance to enable effective pharmacologic targeting. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 synthetic-lethal screening to identify functional modulators of etoposide response in leukemic cell line and integrated results from CRISPR-screen with gene expression and clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with AML treated with etoposide-containing regimen. Our results confirmed the involvement of well-characterized genes, including TOP2A and ABCC1, as well as identified novel genes such as RAD54L2, PRKDC, and ZNF451 that have potential to be novel drug targets. This study demonstrates the ability for leveraging CRISPR/Cas9 screening in conjunction with clinically relevant endpoints to make meaningful discoveries for the identification of prognostic biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets to overcome treatment resistance."

We examined a chemo-resistant SCLC cell line using genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening and identified serine/threonine kinase cell division cycle 7 (CDC7) as a potential synergistic target. Silencing CDC7 in chemo-resistant SCLC cells decreased the IC<sub>50</sub> and improved the efficacy of chemotherapy. Based on the highest single agent model, the CDC7 inhibitor XL413 had a synergistic effect with both cisplatin and etoposide in chemo-resistant SCLC cells, but had no such effect in chemo-sensitive SCLC cells; the combination of XL413 and chemotherapy significantly inhibited cell growth. Western blot and flow cytometry showed that the combined treatments increased apoptosis, whereas XL413 alone had little effect on apoptosis. An analysis of cell cycle and cyclin protein levels indicated that the combination of XL413 and chemotherapy-induced G1/S phase arrest and DNA damage in chemo-resistant SCLC cells. Xenografted tumor and histoculture drug response assays using patient-derived xenografts showed that XL413 improved the efficacy of chemotherapy in vivo and with SCLC tissues. These results suggest that XL413 exerts a synergistic effect with chemotherapy on chemo-resistant SCLC."

        "Abstract": "The molecular complexity of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presents a considerable challenge to implementation of clinical genetic testing for accurate risk stratification. Identification of better biomarkers therefore remains a high priority to enable improving established stratification and guiding risk-adapted therapy decisions. We systematically integrated and analyzed the genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 data from more than 1,000 in vitro and in vivo knockout screens to identify the AML-specific fitness genes. A prognostic fitness score was developed using the sparse regression analysis in a training cohort of 618 cases and validated in five publicly available independent cohorts (n = 1,570) and our RJAML cohort (n = 157) with matched RNA sequencing and targeted gene sequencing performed. A total of 280 genes were identified as AML fitness genes and a 16-gene AML fitness (AFG16) score was further generated and displayed highly prognostic power in more than 2,300 patients with AML. The AFG16 score was able to distill downstream consequences of several genetic abnormalities and can substantially improve the European LeukemiaNet classification. The multi-omics data from the RJAML cohort further demonstrated its clinical applicability. Patients with high AFG16 scores had significantly poor response to induction chemotherapy. Ex vivo drug screening indicated that patients with high AFG16 scores were more sensitive to the cell-cycle inhibitors flavopiridol and SNS-032, and exhibited strongly activated cell-cycle signaling. Our findings demonstrated the utility of the AFG16 score as a powerful tool for better risk stratification and selecting patients most likely to benefit from chemotherapy and alternative experimental therapies."

        "Abstract": "Chemotherapy can eradicate a majority of cancer cells. However, a small population of tumor cells often survives drug treatments through genetic and/or non-genetic mechanisms, leading to tumor recurrence. Here we report a reversible chemoresistance phenotype regulated by the mTOR pathway. Through a genome-wide CRISPR knockout library screen in pancreatic cancer cells treated with chemotherapeutic agents, we have identified the mTOR pathway as a prominent determinant of chemosensitivity. Pharmacological suppression of mTOR activity in cancer cells from diverse tissue origins leads to the persistence of a reversibly resistant population, which is otherwise eliminated by chemotherapeutic agents. Conversely, activation of the mTOR pathway increases chemosensitivity in vitro and in vivo and predicts better survival among various human cancers. Persister cells display a senescence phenotype. Inhibition of mTOR does not induce cellular senescence per se, but rather promotes the survival of senescent cells through regulation of autophagy and G2/M cell cycle arrest, as revealed by a small-molecule chemical library screen. Thus, mTOR plays a causal yet paradoxical role in regulating chemotherapeutic response; inhibition of the mTOR pathway, while suppressing tumor expansion, facilitates the development of a reversible drug-tolerant senescence state."

While multiple chemotherapeutic regimens, including ruxolitinib monotherapy and/or its combination with chemotherapy, are being tested, their efficacy is reportedly limited. To identify molecules/pathways relevant for IgH-CRLF2-r ALL pathogenesis, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 dropout screens in the presence or absence of ruxolitinib using 2 IgH-CRLF2-r ALL lines that differ in RAS mutational status. To do so, we employed a baboon envelope pseudotyped lentiviral vector system, which enabled, for the first time, highly efficient transduction of human B cells. While single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting CRLF2, IL7RA, or JAK1/2 significantly affected cell fitness in both lines, those targeting STAT5A, STAT5B, or STAT3 did not, suggesting that STAT signaling is largely dispensable for IgH-CRLF2-r ALL cell survival. We show that regulators of RAS signaling are critical for cell fitness and ruxolitinib sensitivity and that CRKL depletion enhances ruxolitinib sensitivity in RAS wild-type (WT) cells. Gilteritinib, a pan-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks CRKL phosphorylation, effectively killed RAS WT IgH-CRLF2-r ALL cells in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, either alone or combined with ruxolitinib. We further show that combining gilteritinib with trametinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, is an effective means to target IgH-CRLF2-r ALL cells regardless of RAS mutational status. Our study delineates molecules/pathways relevant for CRLF2-r ALL pathogenesis and could suggest rationally designed combination therapies appropriate for disease subtypes."

We previously showed that upregulated UBQLN4 determines the DNA damage response (DDR) through the degradation of MRE11A. However, the regulatory mechanism at DNA level, transcriptionally and post-transcriptional levels that control <i>UBQLN4</i> mRNA levels remains unknown. In this study, we screened 32 solid tumor types and validated our findings by immunohistochemistry analysis. UBQLN4 is upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels and the most significant values were observed in liver, breast, ovarian, lung, and esophageal cancers. Patients with high <i>UBQLN4</i> mRNA levels had significantly poor prognoses in 20 of 32 cancer types. DNA amplification was identified as the main mechanism promoting UBQLN4 upregulation in multiple cancers, even in the early phases of tumor development. Using CRISPR screen datasets, <i>UBQLN4</i> was identified as a common essential gene for tumor cell viability in 81.1% (860/1,060) of the solid tumor derived cell lines. Ovarian cancer cell lines with high <i>UBQLN4</i> mRNA levels were platinum-based chemotherapy resistant, while they were more sensitive to poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). Our findings highlight the utilities of <i>UBQLN4</i> as a significant pan-cancer theranostic factor and a precision oncology biomarker for DDR-related drug resistance."

By performing genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 library knockdown screening, we found that mitochondrial elongation factor 2 (MIEF2) was among the top candidate genes. The OXL-resistant cell lines and organoids developed in the present study showed stable but low expression of MIEF2. Reduced MIEF2 expression may enhance CRC resistance to OXL by reducing mitochondrial stability and inhibiting apoptosis by decreasing cytochrome C release. In conclusion, among the different biomarkers of OXL resistance in CRC, MIEF2 may serve as a specific biomarker of OXL responsiveness and a potential target for the development of therapies to improve chemotherapeutic effectiveness."

        "Abstract": "FBXW7 is one of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressors, deficiency of which has been associated with resistance to some anticancer therapies. Through bioinformatics and genome-wide CRISPR screens, we here reveal that FBXW7 deficiency leads to multidrug resistance (MDR). Proteomic analyses found an upregulation of mitochondrial factors as a hallmark of FBXW7 deficiency, which has been previously linked to chemotherapy resistance. Despite this increased expression of mitochondrial factors, functional analyses revealed that mitochondria are under stress, and genetic or chemical targeting of mitochondria is preferentially toxic for FBXW7-deficient cells. Mechanistically, the toxicity of therapies targeting mitochondrial translation such as the antibiotic tigecycline relates to the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) in a GCN2 kinase-dependent manner. Furthermore, the discovery of additional drugs that are toxic for FBXW7-deficient cells showed that all of them unexpectedly activate a GCN2-dependent ISR regardless of their accepted mechanism of action. Our study reveals that while one of the most frequent mutations in cancer reduces the sensitivity to the vast majority of available therapies, it renders cells vulnerable to ISR-activating drugs."

        "Abstract": "Bladder cancer (BCa) is the 10th most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, and cellular senescence is defined as a state of permanent cell cycle arrest and considered to play important roles in the development and progression of tumor. However, the comprehensive effect of senescence in BCa has not ever been systematically evaluated. Using the genome-wide CRISPR screening data acquired from DepMap (Cancer Dependency Map), senescence genes from the CellAge database, and gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we screened out 12 senescence genes which might play critical roles in BCa. A four-cell-senescence-regulator-gene prognostic index was constructed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate COX regression model. The transcriptomic data and clinical information of BCa patients were downloaded from TCGA and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We randomly divided the patients in TCGA cohort into training and testing cohorts and calculated the risk score according to the expression of the four senescence genes. The validity of this risk score was validated in the testing cohort (TCGA) and validation cohort (GSE13507). The Kaplan-Meier curves revealed a significant difference in the survival outcome between the high- and low-risk score groups. A nomogram including the risk score and other clinical factors (age, gender, stage, and grade) was established with better predictive capacity of OS in 1, 3, and 5 years. Besides, we found that patients in the high-risk group had higher tumor mutation burden (TMB); lower immune, stroma, and ESTIMATE scores; higher tumor purity; aberrant immune functions; and lower expression of immune checkpoints. We also performed gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to investigate the interaction between risk score and hallmark pathways and found that a high risk score was connected with activation of senescence-related pathways. Furthermore, we found that a high risk score was related to better response to immunotherapy and chemotherapy. In conclusion, we identified a four-cell-senescence-regulator-gene prognostic index in BCa and investigated its relationship with TMB, the immune landscape of tumor microenvironment (TME), and response to immunotherapy and chemotherapy, and we also established a nomogram to predict the prognosis of patients with BCa."

        "Abstract": "Partial or total resistance to preoperative chemoradiotherapy occurs in more than half of locally advanced rectal cancer patients. Several novel or repurposed drugs have been trialled to improve cancer cell sensitivity to radiotherapy, with limited success. We aimed to understand the mechanisms of resistance to chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer using patient derived organoid models. To understand the mechanisms underlying this resistance, we compared the pre-treatment transcriptomes of patient-derived organoids (PDO) with measured radiotherapy sensitivity to identify biological pathways involved in radiation resistance coupled with single cell sequencing, genome wide CRISPR-Cas9 and targeted drug screens. RNA sequencing enrichment analysis revealed upregulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and epithelial mesenchymal transition pathway genes in radioresistant PDOs. Single-cell sequencing of pre & post-irradiation PDOs showed mTORC1 and PI3K/AKT upregulation, which was confirmed by a genome-wide CRSIPR-Cas9 knockout screen using irradiated colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines. We then tested the efficiency of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in improving cancer cell sensitivity to radiotherapy. After irradiation, significant AKT phosphorylation was detected (<i>p</i>=0.027) which was abrogated with dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors and lead to significant radiosensitisation of the HCT116 cell line and radiation resistant PDO lines. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway upregulation contributes to radioresistance and its targeted pharmacological inhibition leads to significant radiosensitisation in CRC organoids, making it a potential target for clinical trials."

Differential gene expression analysis, univariate COX regression analysis, random forest algorithm and multiple combinatorial screening were used to construct a prognostic gene signature. Then the predictive power of the gene signature was validated in the TCGA and ICGC datasets. Furthermore, potential drugs targeting this gene signature were screened. <b>Results:</b> A total of 640 DEGs related to HCC proliferation were identified. Using univariate Cox analysis and random forest algorithm, 10 hub genes were screened. Subsequently, using multiplex combinatorial screening, five hub genes (FARSB, NOP58, CCT4, DHX37 and YARS) were identified. Taking the median risk score as a cutoff value, HCC patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis performed in the training set showed that the overall survival of the high-risk group was worse than that of the low-risk group (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The ROC curve showed a good predictive efficiency of the risk score (AUC > 0.699). The risk score was related to gene mutation, cancer cell stemness and immune function changes. Prediction of immunotherapy suggetsted the IC50s of immune checkpoint inhibitors including A-443654, ABT-888, AG-014699, ATRA, AUY-922, and AZ-628 in the high-risk group were lower than those in the low-risk group, while the IC50s of AMG-706, A-770041, AICAR, AKT inhibitor VIII, Axitinib, and AZD-0530 in the high-risk group were higher than those in the low-risk group. Drug sensitivity analysis indicated that FARSB was positively correlated with Hydroxyurea, Vorinostat, Nelarabine, and Lomustine, while negatively correlated with JNJ-42756493. DHX37 was positively correlated with Raltitrexed, Cytarabine, Cisplatin, Tiotepa, and Triethylene Melamine. YARS was positively correlated with Axitinib, Fluphenazine and Megestrol acetate. NOP58 was positively correlated with Vorinostat and 6-thioguanine. CCT4 was positively correlated with Nerabine. <b>Conclusion:</b> The five-gene signature associated with proliferation can be used for survival prediction and risk stratification for HCC patients. Potential drugs targeting this gene signature deserve further attention in the treatment of HCC."

        "Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers. Due to the difficulty of early diagnosis, most patients are diagnosed with metastasis or advanced-stage cancer, limiting the possibility of surgical treatment. Therefore, chemotherapy is applied to improve patient outcomes, and gemcitabine has been the primary chemotherapy drug for pancreatic cancer for over a decade. However, drug resistance poses a significant challenge to the efficacy of chemotherapy. The CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) gene-editing system is a powerful tool, and researchers have developed CRISPR/Cas9 library screening as a means to identify the genes associated with specific phenotype changes. We performed genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening in the mouse pancreatic cancer cell line TB32047 with gemcitabine treatment and identified deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) and cyclin L1 (CCNL1) as the top hits. We knocked out DCK and CCNL1 in the TB32047 and PANC1 cell lines and confirmed that the loss of DCK or CCNL1 enhanced gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cells. Many researchers have addressed the mechanism of DCK-related gemcitabine resistance; however, no study has focused on CCNL1 and gemcitabine resistance. Therefore, we explored the mechanism of CCNL1-related gemcitabine resistance and found that the loss of CCNL1 activates the ERK/AKT/STAT3 survival pathway, causing cell resistance to gemcitabine treatment."

In this study, we aimed to identify therapeutic targets for this subgroup of NSCLC patients. We performed genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens in two NSCLC cell lines carrying wild-type TP53 and receptor tyrosine kinase (wtTP53-RTK) genes using a GeCKO v2.0 lentiviral library (containing 123411 sgRNAs and targeting 19050 genes). MAGeCKFlute was used to analyse and identify candidate genes. Genetic perturbation and pharmacological inhibition were used to validate the result in vitro and in vivo. The Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening identified MDM2 as a potential therapeutic target for wtTP53-RTK NSCLC. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of MDM2 reduced cell proliferation and impaired tumour growth in the xenograft model, thus confirming the finding of the CRISPR/Cas9 screening. Moreover, treatment by a selective MDM2 inhibitor RG7388 triggered both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in several NSCLC cell lines. Additionally, RG7388 and pemetrexed synergistically blocked the cell proliferation and growth of wtTP53-RTK tumours but had limited effects for other genotypes. We identified MDM2 as an essential gene and a potential therapeutic target in wtTP53-RTK NSCLC via a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening. For this subgroup, treatment by RG7388 alone or by its combination with pemetrexed resulted in significant tumour inhibition."

        "Abstract": "Alterations in histone modifications have been reported to be related to tumorigenicity and tumor progression. However, whether histone modification can aid the classification of patients or influence clinical behavior in patients with colon cancer remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate histone modifier expression patterns using the unsupervised clustering of the transcriptomic expressions of 88 histone acetylation and methylation regulators. In this study, by consensus clustering analysis based on the transcriptome data of 88 histone modification regulators, we identified four distinct expression patterns of histone modifiers associated with different prognoses, intrinsic fluorouracil sensitivities, biological pathways, and tumor microenvironment characteristics among 1372 colon cancer samples. In these four clusters, the HMC4 cluster represented a stroma activation phenotype characterized by both the worst prognosis and lowest response rates to fluorouracil treatment. Then, we established a scoring scheme comprising 155 genes designated as \"HM_score\" by using the Boruta algorithm to distinguish colon cancer patients within the HMC4 cluster. Patients with a high HM_score were considered to have high stromal pathway activation, high stromal fraction, and an unfavorable prognosis. Further analyses indicated that a high HM_score also correlated with reduced therapeutic benefits from fluorouracil chemotherapy. Moreover, through CRISPR library screening, ZEB2 was found to be a critical driver gene that mediates fluorouracil resistance, which is associated with histone modifier expression patterns. This study highlights that characterizing histone modifier expression patterns may help better understand the epigenetic mechanisms underlying tumor heterogeneity in patients with colon cancer and provide more personalized therapeutic strategies."

        "Abstract": "Current clinical factors for screening candidates that might benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in colon cancer are inadequate. Tumor microenvironment, especially the stromal components, has the potential to determine treatment response. However, clinical translation of the tumor-associated stromal characterization into a practical biomarker for helping treatment decision has not been established. Using machine learning, we established a novel 31-gene signature, called stromal cell infiltration intensity score (SIIS), to distinguish patients characterized by the enrichment of abundant stromal cells in five colon cancer datasets from GEO (N\u00a0=\u00a0990). Patients with high-SIIS were at higher risk for recurrence and mortality, and could not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy due to their intrinsic drug resistance; however, the opposite was reported for patients with low-SIIS. The role of SIIS in detection of patients with high stromal cell infiltration and reduced drug efficiency was consistently validated in the TCGA-COAD cohort (N\u00a0=\u00a0382), Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center cohort (N\u00a0=\u00a030), and could also be observed in TCGA pan-cancer settings (N\u00a0=\u00a04898) and four independent immunotherapy cohorts (N\u00a0=\u00a0467). Based on multi-omics data analysis and the CRISPR library screen, we reported that lack of gene mutation, hypomethylation in ADCY4 promoter region, activation of WNT-PCP pathway and SIAH2-GPX3 axis were potential mechanisms responsible for the chemoresistance of patients within high-SIIS group. Our findings demonstrated that SIIS provide an important reference for those making treatment decisions for such special patients."

        "Abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is a malignant bone tumor mostly occurring in children and adolescents, while chemotherapy resistance often develops and the mechanisms involved remain challenging to be fully investigated. Genome-wide CRISPR screening combined with transcriptomic sequencing were used to identify the critical genes of doxorubicin resistance. Analysis of clinical samples and datasets, and in vitro and in vivo experiments (including CCK-8, apoptosis, western blot, qRT-PCR and mouse models) were applied to confirm the function of these genes. The bioinformatics and IP-MS assays were utilized to further verify the downstream pathway. RGD peptide-directed and exosome-delivered siRNA were developed for the novel therapy strategy. We identified that E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Rad18 (Rad18) contributed to doxorubicin-resistance in OS. Further exploration revealed that Rad18 interact with meiotic recombination 11 (MRE11) to promote the formation of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex, facilitating the activation of the homologous recombination (HR) pathway, which ultimately mediated DNA damage tolerance and leaded to a poor prognosis and chemotherapy response in patients with OS. Rad18-knockout effectively restored the chemotherapy response in vitro and in vivo. Also, RGD-exosome loading chemically modified siRad18 combined with doxorubicin, where exosome and chemical modification guaranteed the stability of siRad18 and the RGD peptide provided prominent targetability, had significantly improved antitumor activity of doxorubicin. Collectively, our study identifies Rad18 as a driver of OS doxorubicin resistance that promotes the HR pathway and indicates that targeting Rad18 is an effective approach to overcome chemotherapy resistance in OS."

To uncover therapeutic targets for tumours with CCNE1 amplification, we undertook genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9-based synthetic lethality screens in cellular models of CCNE1 amplification. Here we report that increasing CCNE1 dosage engenders a vulnerability to the inhibition of the PKMYT1 kinase, a negative regulator of CDK1. To inhibit PKMYT1, we developed RP-6306, an orally bioavailable and selective inhibitor that shows single-agent activity and durable tumour regressions when combined with gemcitabine in models of CCNE1 amplification. RP-6306 treatment causes unscheduled activation of CDK1 selectively in CCNE1-overexpressing cells, promoting early mitosis in cells undergoing DNA synthesis. CCNE1 overexpression disrupts CDK1 homeostasis at least in part through an early activation of the MMB-FOXM1 mitotic transcriptional program. We conclude that PKMYT1 inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for CCNE1-amplified cancers."

Targeting histone acetylation provides new strategies for the treatment of cancers. As a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor, panobinostat has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of multiple myeloma and has shown promising antileukemia effects in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, the underlying drug resistance mechanism in ALL remains largely unknown. Using genome-wide Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas)9\u00a0(CRISPR/Cas9) screening, we identified mitochondrial activity as the driver of panobinostat resistance in ALL. Mechanistically, ectopic SIRT1 expression activated mitochondrial activity and sensitized ALL to panobinostat through activating mitochondria-related apoptosis pathway. Meanwhile, the transcription level of SIRT1 was significantly associated with panobinostat sensitivity across diverse tumor types and thus could be a potential biomarker of panobinostat response in cancers. Our data suggest that patients with higher SIRT1 expression in cancer cells might benefit from panobinostat treatment, supporting the implementation of combinatorial therapy with SIRT1 or mitochondrial activators to overcome panobinostat resistance."

        "Abstract": "The overall response of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BUC) remains unsatisfactory due to the complex pathological subtypes, genomic difference, and drug resistance. The genes that associated with cisplatin resistance remain unclear. Herein, we aimed to identify the cisplatin resistance associated genes in BUC. EXPERIMENTAL\u00a0DESIGN: The cytotoxicity of cisplatin was evaluated in six bladder cancer cell lines to compare their responses to cisplatin. The T24 cancer cells exhibited the lowest sensitivity to cisplatin and was therefore selected to explore the mechanisms of drug resistance. We performed genome-wide CRISPR screening in T24 cancer cells in vitro, and identified that the gene heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (HNRNPU) was the top candidate gene related to cisplatin resistance. Epigenetic and transcriptional profiles of HNRNPU-depleted cells after cisplatin treatment were analyzed to investigate the relationship between HNRNPU and cisplatin resistance. In vivo experiments were also performed to demonstrate the function of HNRNPU depletion in cisplatin sensitivity. Significant correlation was found between HNRNPU expression level and sensitivity to cisplatin in bladder cancer cell lines. In the high HNRNPU expressing T24 cancer cells, knockout of HNRNPU inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and migration. In addition, loss of HNRNPU promoted apoptosis and S-phase arrest in the T24 cells treated with cisplatin. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrated that HNRNPU expression was significantly higher in tumor tissues than in normal tissues. High HNRNPU level was negatively correlated with patient survival. Transcriptomic profiling analysis showed that knockout of HNRNPU enhanced cisplatin sensitivity by regulating DNA damage repair genes. Furthermore, it was found that HNRNPU regulates chemosensitivity by affecting the expression of neurofibromin 1 (NF1). Our study demonstrated that HNRNPU expression is associated with cisplatin sensitivity in bladder urothelial carcinoma cells. Inhibition of HNRNPU could be a potential therapy for cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer."

        "Abstract": "Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is an aggressive lymphoma type that is currently treated by intensive chemoimmunotherapy. Despite the favorable clinical outcome for most patients with BL, chemotherapy-related toxicity and disease relapse remain major clinical challenges, emphasizing the need for innovative therapies. Using genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screens, we identified B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, specific transcriptional regulators, and one-carbon metabolism as vulnerabilities in BL. We focused on serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2), a key enzyme in one-carbon metabolism. Inhibition of SHMT2 by either knockdown or pharmacological compounds induced anti-BL effects in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Mechanistically, SHMT2 inhibition led to a significant reduction of intracellular glycine and formate levels, which inhibited the mTOR pathway and thereby triggered autophagic degradation of the oncogenic transcription factor TCF3. Consequently, this led to a collapse of tonic BCR signaling, which is controlled by TCF3 and is essential for BL cell survival. In terms of clinical translation, we also identified drugs such as methotrexate that synergized with SHMT inhibitors. Overall, our study has uncovered the dependency landscape in BL, identified and validated SHMT2 as a drug target, and revealed a mechanistic link between SHMT2 and the transcriptional master regulator TCF3, opening up new perspectives for innovative therapies."

        "Abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most fatal of all primary human brain tumors with 14 months median survival. The mainstay therapy for this tumor involves temozolomide, surgery, radiotherapy and tumor treating electric field. Cancer resistance to commonly available chemotherapeutics remains a major challenge in glioblastoma patients receiving treatment and unfavorably impact their overall survival and outcome. However, the lack of progress in this area could be attributed to lack of tools to probe unbiasedly at the genome wide level the coding and non-coding elements contribution on a large scale for factors that control resistance to chemotherapeutics. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapeutics will enable precision medicine in the treatment of cancer patients. CRISPR Cas9a has emerged as a functional genomics tool to study at genome level the factors that control cancer resistance to drugs. Recently, we used genome wide CRISPR-Cas9a screen to identify genes responsible for glioblastoma susceptibility to etoposide. We extended our inquiry to understand genes that control glioblastoma response to temozolomide by using genome scale CRISPR. This study shows that the unbiased genome-wide loss of function approach can be applied to discover genes that influence tumor resistance to chemotherapeutics and contribute to chemoresistance in glioblastoma."

Epigenetics targeted chemotherapeutic approach can be used to overcome treatment resistance and low response rate in HCC. However, a comprehensive review of genomic data was carried out to determine the role of epigenesis in the tumor microenvironment (TME), immune cell-infiltration characteristics in HCC is still insufficient. The association between epigenetic-related genes (ERGs), inflammatory response-related genes (IRRGs) and CRISPR genes was determined by merging genomic and CRISPR data. Further, characteristics of immune-cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment was evaluated. Nine differentially expressed genes (<i>ANP32B, ASF1A, BCORL1, BMI1, BUB1, CBX2, CBX3, CDK1</i>, and <i>CDK5</i>) were shown to be independent prognostic factors based on lasso regression in the TCGA-LIHC and ICGC databases. In addition, the results showed significant differences in expression of <i>PDCD-1</i> (<i>PD-1</i>) and <i>CTLA4</i> between the high- and low-epigenetic score groups. The CTRP and PRISM-derived drug response data yielded four CTRP-derived compounds (SB-743921, GSK461364, gemcitabine, and paclitaxel) and two PRISM-derived compounds (dolastatin-10 and LY2606368). Patients with high ERGs benefited more from immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy than patients with low ERGs. In addition, the high ERGs subgroup had a higher T cell exclusion score, while the low ERGs subgroup had a higher T cell dysfunction. However, there was no difference in microsatellite instability (MSI) score among the two subgroups. Further, genome-wide CRISPR-based loss-of function screening derived from DepMap was conducted to determine key genes leading to HCC development and progression. In total, 640 genes were identified to be essential for survival in HCC cell lines. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network demonstrated that IRRGs <i>PSEN1</i> was linked to most ERGs and CRISPR genes such as <i>CDK1, TOP2A, CBX2</i> and <i>CBX3.</i> Epigenetic alterations of cancer-related genes in the tumor microenvironment play a major role in carcinogenesis. This study showed that epigenetic-related novel biomarkers could be useful in predicting prognosis, clinical diagnosis, and management in HCC."

        "Abstract": "Despite progress in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), T-cell ALL (T-ALL) has limited treatment options, particularly in the setting of relapsed/refractory disease. Using an unbiased genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen we sought to identify pathway dependencies for T-ALL which could be harnessed for therapy development. Disruption of the one-carbon folate, purine and pyrimidine pathways scored as the top metabolic pathways required for T-ALL proliferation. We used a recently developed inhibitor of SHMT1 and SHMT2, RZ-2994, to characterize the effect of inhibiting these enzymes of the one-carbon folate pathway in T-ALL and found that T-ALL cell lines were differentially sensitive to RZ-2994, with the drug inducing a S/G2 cell cycle arrest. The effects of SHMT1/2 inhibition were rescued by formate supplementation. Loss of both SHMT1 and SHMT2 was necessary for impaired growth and cell cycle arrest, with suppression of both SHMT1 and SHMT2 inhibiting leukemia progression in vivo. RZ-2994 also decreased leukemia burden in vivo and remained effective in the setting of methotrexate resistance in vitro. This study highlights the significance of the one-carbon folate pathway in T-ALL and supports further development of SHMT inhibitors for treatment of T-ALL and other cancers."

However, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear yet. In the present study, we applied a genome-scale CRISPR knockout screen in combination of NGS sequencing upon CRC cell lines to explore regulatory factors involved radioresistance of CRC, and 3 candidate genes were identified. Cytotoxicity of IR was determined by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay and apoptosis assay, and microRNA-5197-5p (miR-5197) was found to significantly enhance the cytotoxicity of IR to CRC cells. By further mechanistic investigation, we demonstrated that miR-5197 directly targeted CDK6 and inhibited its expression in RKO cells, which induced cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase and inhibited cell division, thereby radiosensitivity was enhanced by miR-5197. Our findings revealed that miR-5197 might be a critical factor regulating CRC cell radiosensitivity and provided novel insights into the development of therapeutic strategies for CRC patients who are resistant to IR."

        "Abstract": "Glioblastomas (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor, and radiotherapy plays a critical role in its therapeutic management. Unfortunately, the development of radioresistance is universal. Here, we identified calcium-regulated heat-stable protein 1 (CARHSP1) as a critical driver for radioresistance utilizing genome-wide CRISPR activation screening. This is a protein with a cold-shock domain (CSD)-containing that is highly similar to cold-shock proteins. CARHSP1 mRNA level was upregulated in irradiation-resistant GBM cells and knockdown of CARHSP1 sensitized GBM cells to radiotherapy. The high expression of CARHSP1 upon radiation might mediate radioresistance by activating the inflammatory signaling pathway. More importantly, patients with high levels of CARHSP1 had poorer survival when treated with radiotherapy. Collectively, our findings suggested that targeting the CARHSP1/TNF-\u03b1 inflammatory signaling activation induced by radiotherapy might directly affect radioresistance and present an attractive therapeutic target for GBM, particularly for patients with high levels of CARHSP1."

        "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients suffer poor outcomes, including a five-year survival of below 10%. Poor outcomes result in part from therapeutic resistance that limits the impact of cytotoxic first-line therapy. Novel therapeutic approaches are needed, but currently no targeted therapies exist to treat PDAC. To assess cellular resistance mechanisms common to four cytotoxic chemotherapies (gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) used to treat PDAC patients, we performed four genome-wide CRISPR activation (CRISPR<sub>act</sub>) and CRISPR knock-out (CRISPR<sub>ko</sub>) screens in two common PDAC cell lines (Panc-1 and BxPC3). We used pathway analysis to identify gene sets enriched among our hits and conducted RNA-sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) to characterize top hits from our screen. We used scratch assays to assess changes in cellular migration with HDAC1 overexpression. Our data revealed activation of ABCG2, a well-described efflux pump, as the most consistent mediator of resistance in each of our screens. CRISPR-mediated activation of genes involved in transcriptional co-repressor complexes also conferred resistance to multiple drugs. Expression of many of these genes, including HDAC1, is associated with reduced survival in PDAC patients. Up-regulation of HDAC1 in vitro increased promoter occupancy and expression of several genes involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These cells also displayed phenotypic changes in cellular migration consistent with activation of the EMT pathway. The expression changes resulting from HDAC1 activation were also observed with activation of several other co-repressor complex members. Finally, we developed a publicly available analysis tool, PancDS, which integrates gene expression profiles with our screen results to predict drug sensitivity in resected PDAC tumors and cell lines. Our results provide a comprehensive resource for identifying cellular mechanisms of drug resistance in PDAC, mechanistically implicate HDAC1, and co-repressor complex members broadly, in multi-drug resistance, and provide an analytical tool for predicting treatment response in PDAC tumors and cell lines."

        "Abstract": "Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic agent, whose efficacy is limited by primary and acquired therapeutic resistance. Recently, a bladder cancer genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out screen correlated cisplatin sensitivity to multiple genetic biomarkers. Among the screen's top hits was the HECT domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase (HUWE1). In this review, HUWE1 is postulated as a therapeutic response modulator, affecting the collision between platinum-DNA adducts and the replication fork, the primary cytotoxic action of platins. HUWE1 can alter the cytotoxic response to platins by targeting essential components of the DNA damage response including BRCA1, p53, and Mcl-1. Deficiency of HUWE1 could lead to enhanced DNA damage repair and a dysfunctional apoptotic apparatus, thereby inducing resistance to platins. Future research on the relationship between HUWE1 and platins could generate new mechanistic insights into therapy resistance. Ultimately, HUWE1 might serve as a clinical biomarker to tailor cancer treatment strategies, thereby improving cancer care and patient outcomes."

To identify unrecognized regulators of cell survival we performed a whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screen using treatment with ionizing radiation as a selective pressure, and identified STING (stimulator of interferon genes) as an intrinsic regulator of tumor cell survival. We show that STING regulates a transcriptional program that controls the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and that STING loss alters ROS homeostasis to reduce DNA damage and to cause therapeutic resistance. In agreement with these data, analysis of tumors from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patient specimens show that low STING expression is associated with worse outcomes. We also demonstrate that pharmacologic activation of STING enhances the effects of ionizing radiation in vivo, providing a rationale for therapeutic combinations of STING agonists and DNA-damaging agents. These results highlight a role for STING that is beyond its canonical function in cyclic dinucleotide and DNA damage sensing, and identify STING as a regulator of cellular ROS homeostasis and tumor cell susceptibility to reactive oxygen dependent, DNA damaging agents."

In particular, APOBEC3A (A3A) has emerged as a major driver of mutagenesis in cancer cells, and its expression results in DNA damage and susceptibility to treatment with inhibitors of the ATR and CHK1 checkpoint kinases. Here, we report the implementation of CRISPR/Cas-9 genetic screening to identify susceptibilities of multiple A3A-expressing lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cell lines. We identify HMCES, a protein recently linked to the protection of abasic sites, as a central protein for the tolerance of A3A expression. HMCES depletion results in synthetic lethality with A3A expression preferentially in a TP53-mutant background. Analysis of previous screening data reveals a strong association between A3A mutational signatures and sensitivity to HMCES loss and indicates that HMCES is specialized in protecting against a narrow spectrum of DNA damaging agents in addition to A3A. We experimentally show that both HMCES disruption and A3A expression increase susceptibility of cancer cells to ionizing radiation (IR), oxidative stress, and ATR inhibition, strategies that are often applied in tumor therapies. Overall, our results suggest that HMCES is an attractive target for selective treatment of A3A-expressing tumors."

        "Abstract": "Cancer is a complex disease resulting from the accumulation of genetic dysfunctions. Tumor heterogeneity causes the molecular variety that divergently controls responses to chemotherapy, leading to the recurrent problem of cancer reappearance. For many decades, efforts have focused on identifying essential tumoral genes and cancer driver mutations. More recently, prompted by the clinical success of the synthetic lethality (SL)-based therapy of the PARP inhibitors in homologous recombinant deficient tumors, scientists have centered their novel research on SL interactions (SLI). The state of the art to find new genetic interactions are currently large-scale forward genetic CRISPR screens. CRISPR technology has rapidly evolved to be a common tool in the vast majority of laboratories, as tools to implement CRISPR screen protocols are available to all researchers. Taking advantage of SLI, combinatorial therapies have become the ultimate model to treat cancer with lower toxicity, and therefore better efficiency. This review explores the CRISPR screen methodology, integrates the up-to-date published findings on CRISPR screens in the cancer field and proposes future directions to uncover cancer regulation and individual responses to chemotherapy."

To develop a risk stratification tool, 56 patients with stage IB-IIB cervical cancer are included in 2 research centers from the discovery cohort. Patient-specific somatic mutations led to NACT non-responsiveness are identified by whole-exome sequencing. Next, CRISPR/Cas9-based library screenings are performed based on these genes to confirm their biological contribution to drug resistance. A 15-gene classifier is developed by generalized linear regression analysis combined with the logistic regression model. In an independent validation cohort of 102 patients, the classifier showed good predictive ability with an area under the curve of 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.69-0.91). Furthermore, the 15-gene classifier is significantly associated with patient responsiveness to NACT in both univariate (odds ratio, 10.8; 95% CI, 3.55-32.86; <i>p</i> = 2.8 \u00d7 10<sup>-5</sup>) and multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 17.34; 95% CI, 4.04-74.40; <i>p</i> = 1.23 \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup>) in the validation set. In conclusion, the 15-gene classifier can accurately predict the clinical response to NACT before treatment, representing a promising approach for guiding the selection of appropriate treatment strategies for locally advanced cervical cancer."

        "Abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are involved in tumorigenesis, recurrence, and therapy resistance. To identify critical regulators of sarcoma CSCs, we performed a reporter-based genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen and uncovered Kruppel-like factor 11 (KLF11) as top candidate. In vitro and in vivo functional annotation defined a negative role of KLF11 in CSCs. Mechanistically, KLF11 and YAP/TEAD bound to adjacent DNA sites along with direct interaction. KLF11 recruited SIN3A/HDAC to suppress the transcriptional output of YAP/TEAD, which, in turn, promoted KLF11 transcription, forming a negative feedback loop. However, in CSCs, this negative feedback was lost because of epigenetic silence of KLF11, causing sustained YAP activation. Low KLF11 was associated with poor prognosis and chemotherapy response in patients with sarcoma. Pharmacological activation of KLF11 by thiazolidinedione effectively restored chemotherapy response. Collectively, our study identifies KLF11 as a negative regulator in sarcoma CSCs and potential therapeutic target."

        "Abstract": "Glioblastoma is a severe type of brain tumor with a poor prognosis and few therapy options. Temozolomide (TMZ) is one of these options, however, with limited success, and failure is mainly due to tumor resistance. In this work, genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 lentiviral screen libraries for gene knockout or activation were transduced in the human glioblastoma cell line, aiming to identify genes that modulate TMZ resistance. The sgRNAs enriched in both libraries in surviving cells after TMZ treatment were identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Pathway analyses of gene candidates on knockout screening revealed several enriched pathways, including the mismatch repair and the Sonic Hedgehog pathways. Silencing three genes ranked on the top 10 list (MSH2, PTCH2, and CLCA2) confirm cell protection from TMZ-induced death. In addition, a CRISPR activation library revealed that NRF2 and Wnt pathways are involved in TMZ resistance. Consistently, overexpression of FZD6, CTNNB1, or NRF2 genes significantly increased cell survival upon TMZ treatment. Moreover, NRF2 and related genes detected in this screen presented a robust negative correlation with glioblastoma patient survival rates. Finally, several gene candidates from knockout or activation screening are targetable by inhibitors or small molecules, and some of them have already been used in the clinic."

        "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most challenging cancers to treat. Due to the asymptomatic nature of the disease and lack of curative treatment modalities, the 5-y survival rate of PDAC patients is one of the lowest of any cancer type. The recurrent genetic alterations in PDAC are yet to be targeted. Therefore, identification of effective drug combinations is desperately needed. Here, we performed an in vivo CRISPR screen in an orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model to identify gene targets whose inhibition creates synergistic tumor growth inhibition with gemcitabine (Gem), a first- or second-line chemotherapeutic agent for PDAC treatment. The approach revealed protein arginine methyltransferase gene 5 (PRMT5) as an effective druggable candidate whose inhibition creates synergistic vulnerability of PDAC cells to Gem. Genetic depletion and pharmacological inhibition indicate that loss of PRMT5 activity synergistically enhances Gem cytotoxicity due to the accumulation of excessive DNA damage. At the molecular level, we show that inhibition of PRMT5 results in RPA depletion and impaired homology-directed DNA repair (HDR) activity. The combination (Gem + PRMT5 inhibition) creates conditional lethality and synergistic reduction of PDAC tumors in vivo. The findings demonstrate that unbiased genetic screenings combined with a clinically relevant model system is a practical approach in identifying synthetic lethal drug combinations for cancer treatment."

By combining these analyses, we uncover diagnostic and relapse-specific mutational mechanisms as well as genetic drivers of chemoresistance. Functionally, our data identifies common and drug-specific pathways modulating chemotherapy response and underscores the effect of drug combinations in restricting the selection of resistance-driving genetic lesions.

To identify candidate therapeutic gene targets, we applied a murine prostate cancer orthograft model that recapitulates clinical invasive prostate cancer in a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen under docetaxel treatment pressure. We identified 17 candidate genes whose suppression may enhance the efficacy of docetaxel, with transcription elongation factor A-like 1 (<i>Tceal1</i>) as the top candidate. TCEAL1 function is not fully characterised; it may modulate transcription in a promoter dependent fashion. Suppressed TCEAL1 expression in multiple human prostate cancer cell lines enhanced therapeutic response to docetaxel. Based on gene set enrichment analysis from transcriptomic data and flow cytometry, we confirmed that loss of TCEAL1 in combination with docetaxel leads to an altered cell cycle profile compared with docetaxel alone, with increased subG1 cell death and increased polyploidy. Here, we report the first in vivo genome-wide treatment sensitisation CRISPR screen in prostate cancer, and present proof of concept data on <i>TCEAL1</i> as a candidate for a combinational strategy with the use of docetaxel."

        "Abstract": "Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a T-cell malignancy predominantly driven by a hyperactive anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion protein. ALK inhibitors, such as crizotinib, provide alternatives to standard chemotherapy with reduced toxicity and side effects. Children with lymphomas driven by nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1)-ALK fusion proteins achieved an objective response rate to ALK inhibition therapy of 54% to 90% in clinical trials; however, a subset of patients progressed within the first 3 months of treatment. The mechanism for the development of ALK inhibitor resistance is unknown. Through genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) activation and knockout screens in ALCL cell lines, combined with RNA sequencing data derived from ALK inhibitor-relapsed patient tumors, we show that resistance to ALK inhibition by crizotinib in ALCL can be driven by aberrant upregulation of interleukin 10 receptor subunit alpha (IL10RA). Elevated IL10RA expression rewires the STAT3 signaling pathway, bypassing otherwise critical phosphorylation by NPM1-ALK. IL-10RA expression does not correlate with response to standard chemotherapy in pediatric patients, suggesting that a combination of crizotinib and chemotherapy could prevent ALK inhibitor resistance-specific relapse."

We aimed to identify candidates causing paclitaxel resistance and explore their significance in TNBC therapeutics. <b>Methods:</b> A genome-wide CRISPR screening, integrated with transcriptome analyses, was performed to identify candidates involved in paclitaxel-resistant TNBCs. Cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, immunofluorescent staining, and xenograft assays were conducted to verify the phenotypes of paclitaxel resistance induced by candidate genes, both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. RNA sequencing, Western blotting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used to explore the underlying mechanisms. <b>Results:</b> MEF2-interacting transcriptional repressor (MITR), the truncated isoform of histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) lacking the deacetylation domain, was enriched in paclitaxel-resistant cells. Elevated MITR expression resulted in increased interleukin-11 (IL11) expression and activation of downstream JAK/STAT3 signaling. Mechanistically, MITR counteracted MEF2A-induced transcriptional suppression of IL11, ultimately causing paclitaxel resistance. By contrast, pharmacological inhibition of JAK1/2 by ruxolitinib reversed paclitaxel resistance both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> genetic and cellular analyses elucidated the pivotal role of MITR/MEF2A/IL11 axis in paclitaxel resistance and provided a novel therapeutic strategy for TNBC patients to overcome poor chemotherapy responses."

Many ZFP protein could inhibit tumor development and malignancy. However, the function of <i>ZNF587B</i> remains unknown. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was utilized to compare <i>ZNF587B</i> mRNA expression levels in OC and normal ovarian cell lines. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) and full-length ZNF587B eukaryotic expression plasmid were constructed and transfected into OC cells later. Colony formation, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay, transwell assay, and xenograft experiment were conducted to evaluate the effect of <i>ZNF587B</i> on OC cells. <i>ZNF587B</i> was downregulated by approximately 43% and 17% in the OC cell lines SKOV3 and A2780, respectively, compared with that in the normal ovarian cell line IOSE80. Overexpression of <i>ZNF587B</i> reduced cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion, which could be reversed by knockdown of ZNF587B via siRNA. Xenograft experiments also confirmed that <i>ZNF587B</i> could suppress tumor growth. Survival data of OC patients in the SurvExpress database showed that with respect to overall survival, low-risk patients grouped by the prognostic index had a higher expression of <i>ZNF587B</i> and a better prognosis than high-risk group (HR = 1.77, 95% CI: 0.55-0.70, p = 0.023). Moreover, overexpression of ZNF587B promoted OC cells apoptosis when pretreated with cisplatin. <i>ZNF587B</i> is a novel potential tumor suppressor of OC and may be a therapeutic target for OC."

We and others had shown that a subset of glioblastomas, the most malignant of all primary brain tumors in adults, is responsive to TOP2 poisons. To identify genes that confer susceptibility to this drug in gliomas, we performed a genome-scale CRISPR knockout screen with etoposide. Genes involved in protein synthesis and DNA damage were implicated in etoposide susceptibility. To define potential biomarkers for TOP2 poisons, CRISPR hits were overlapped with genes whose expression correlates with susceptibility to this drug across glioma cell lines, revealing ribosomal protein subunit RPS11, 16, and 18 as putative biomarkers for response to TOP2 poisons. Loss of RPS11 led to resistance to etoposide and doxorubicin and impaired the induction of proapoptotic gene APAF1 following treatment. The expression of these ribosomal subunits was also associated with susceptibility to TOP2 poisons across cell lines from gliomas and multiple other cancers."

        "Abstract": "Cells deficient in ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and other anti-cancer agents that induce double-strand DNA breaks. ATM inhibitors may therefore sensitize cancer cells to these agents. Some cancers may also have underlying genetic defects predisposing them to an ATM inhibitor monotherapy response. We have conducted a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genetic vulnerabilities that sensitize lung cancer cells to ATM inhibitors. Knockout of genes in the Fanconi anemia (FA)/BRCA pathway results in hypersensitivity to the ATM inhibitor M3541. Knockdown of either an FA gene or of ATM results in reduced double-strand break end resection, enhanced non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair, and decreased homologous recombination repair. Knockout of both the FA/BRCA pathway and ATM strongly inhibits end resection and generates toxic levels of NHEJ, thereby elucidating a mechanism of cellular death by synthetic lethality. ATM inhibitors may therefore be useful for the treatment of tumors with a defective FA/BRCA pathway."

        "Abstract": "DNA damage response (DDR) is critically important for cell survival, genome maintenance, and its defect has been exploited therapeutically in cancer treatment. Many DDR-targeting agents have been generated and have entered the clinic and/or clinical trials. In order to provide a global and unbiased view of DDR network, we designed a focused CRISPR library targeting 365 DDR genes and performed CRISPR screens on the responses to several DDR inhibitors and DNA-damaging agents in 293A cells. With these screens, we determined responsive pathways enriched under treatment with different types of small-molecule agents. Additionally, we showed that POLE3/4-deficient cells displayed enhanced sensitivity to an ATR inhibitor, a PARP inhibitor, and camptothecin. Moreover, by performing DDR screens in isogenic TP53 wild-type and TP53 knock-out cell lines, our results suggest that the performance of our CRISPR DDR dropout screens is independent of TP53 status. Collectively, our findings indicate that CRISPR DDR screens can be used to identify potential targets of small-molecule drugs and reveal that TP53 status does not affect the outcome of these screens."

        "Abstract": "Sorafenib is the first-line drug used for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, acquired sorafenib resistance in cancer patients limits its efficacy. Here, we performed the first genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based screening on sorafenib-treated HCC cells to identify essential genes for non-mutational mechanisms related to acquired sorafenib resistance and/or sensitivity in HCC cells. KEAP1 was identified as the top candidate gene by Model-based Analysis of Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 Knockout (MAGeCK). KEAP1 disrupted HCC cells were less sensitive than wild-type cells in short- and long-term sorafenib treatments. Compared to wild-type cells, KEAP1-disrupted cells showed lower basal and sorafenib-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and were more resistant to oxidative stress-induced cell death. The absence of KEAP1 led to increased activity of Nrf2, a key transcription factor controlling antioxidant responses, as further evidenced by increased expression of Nrf2-controlled genes including NQO1, GPX2 and TXNRD1, which were positively associated with chemoresistance. In addition, KEAP1 disruption counteracted the reduction of cell viability and the elevation of ROS caused by lenvatinib, a drug that recently showed clinical efficacy as a first-line treatment for unresectable HCC. Finally, Keap1 disruption also increased the resistance of cells to regorafenib, a recently approved drug to treat HCC as a second line therapy. Taken together, our data indicate that deregulation of the KEAP1/Nrf2 pathway following KEAP1 inactivation contributes to sorafenib, lenvatinib, and regorafenib resistance in human HCC cells through up-regulation of Nrf2 downstream genes and decreased ROS levels."

After intake, gemcitabine is transferred to the cells by the membrane nucleoside transporter proteins. Once inside the cells, it is converted to gemcitabine triphosphate followed by incorporation into DNA chains where it causes inhibition of DNA replication and thereby cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Currently gemcitabine is the standard drug for treatment of pancreatic cancer and despite its widespread use its effect is moderate. In this study, we performed a genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screening on pancreatic cancer cell line Panc1 to explore the genes that are important for gemcitabine efficacy. We found SH3D21 as a novel gemcitabine sensitizer implying it may act as a therapeutic target for improvement of gemcitabine efficacy in treatment of pancreatic cancer."

Here, we utilize a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify that loss of ELP5 reduces the gemcitabine-induced apoptosis in GBC cells in a P53-dependent manner through the Elongator complex and other uridine 34 (U<sub>34</sub>) tRNA-modifying enzymes. Mechanistically, loss of ELP5 impairs the integrity and stability of the Elongator complex to abrogate wobble U<sub>34</sub> tRNA modification, and directly impedes the wobble U<sub>34</sub> modification-dependent translation of hnRNPQ mRNA, a validated P53 internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) trans-acting factor. Downregulated hnRNPQ is unable to drive P53 IRES-dependent translation, but rescuing a U<sub>34</sub> modification-independent hnRNPQ mutant could restore P53 translation and gemcitabine sensitivity in ELP5-depleted GBC cells. GBC patients with lower ELP5, hnRNPQ, or P53 expression have poor survival outcomes after gemcitabine chemotherapy. These results indicate that the Elongator/hnRNPQ/P53 axis controls gemcitabine sensitivity in GBC cells."

        "Abstract": "The accumulation of DNA in the cytosol serves as a key immunostimulatory signal associated with infections, cancer and genomic damage<sup>1,2</sup>. Cytosolic DNA triggers immune responses by activating the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway<sup>3</sup>. The binding of DNA to cGAS activates its enzymatic activity, leading to the synthesis of a second messenger, cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (2'3'-cGAMP)<sup>4-7</sup>. This cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) activates STING<sup>8</sup>, which in turn activates the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor \u03ba-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB), promoting the transcription of genes encoding type I interferons and other cytokines and mediators that stimulate a broader immune response. Exogenous 2'3'-cGAMP produced by malignant cells<sup>9</sup> and other CDNs, including those produced by bacteria<sup>10-12</sup> and synthetic CDNs used in cancer immunotherapy<sup>13,14</sup>, must traverse the cell membrane to activate STING in target cells. How these charged CDNs pass through the lipid bilayer is unknown. Here we used a genome-wide CRISPR-interference screen to identify the reduced folate carrier SLC19A1, a folate-organic phosphate antiporter, as the major transporter of CDNs. Depleting SLC19A1 in human cells inhibits CDN uptake and functional responses, and overexpressing SLC19A1 increases both uptake and functional responses. In human cell lines and primary cells ex vivo, CDN uptake is inhibited by folates as well as two medications approved for treatment of inflammatory diseases, sulfasalazine and the antifolate methotrexate. The identification of SLC19A1 as the major transporter of CDNs into cells has implications for the immunotherapeutic treatment of cancer<sup>13</sup>, host responsiveness to CDN-producing pathogenic microorganisms<sup>11</sup> and-potentially-for some inflammatory diseases."

        "Abstract": "Radiotherapy is one of the most used treatment approaches for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Targeted inhibition of DNA repair machinery has the potential to improve treatment response by tailoring treatment to cancer cells lacking specific DNA repair pathways. Human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative and HPV-positive HNSCCs respond differently to radiotherapy treatment, suggesting that different approaches of DNA repair inhibition should be employed for these HNSCC groups. Here, we searched for optimal radiosensitization approaches for HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCCs by performing a targeted CRISPR-Cas9 screen. We found that inhibition of base excision repair resulted in a better radiotherapy response in HPV-positive HNSCC, which is correlated with upregulation of genes involved in base excision repair. In contrast, inhibition of nonhomologous end-joining and mismatch repair showed strong effects in both HNSCC groups. We validated the screen results by combining radiotherapy with targeted inhibition of DNA repair in several preclinical models including primary and recurrent patient-derived HNSCC xenografts. These findings underline the importance of stratifying HNSCC patients for combination treatments."

        "Abstract": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) may provide survival benefits for patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, tumor cells can display primary or secondary resistance to paclitaxel (PTX), a primary component of induction chemotherapy regimen. To identify genes capable of conveying PTX resistance, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR transcriptional activation library in human KYSE-180 cells. High throughput next generation sequencing was further applied to establish the phenotype-to-genotype relationship. Our highest-ranking hits are CDKN1A, TSPAN4, ELAVL2, JUNB and PAAF1. We generated evidence that esophageal tumors with high CDKN1A, ELAVL2 and TSPAN4 levels, quantified using qRT-PCR and Western blot assays, showed poorer chemotherapy response. Higher expression levels of TSPAN4 and ELAVL2 protein are independent risk factors for poor chemotherapy response in ESCC patients. We then found that overexpression of CDKN1A, ELAVL2 or TSPAN4 in ESCC cell lines significantly promoted the resistance to PTX by inhibiting cell apoptosis. Interestingly, ESCC cells overexpressed CDKN1A, ELAVL2 or TSPAN4 also acquired resistance to cisplatin (DDP). This phenomenon may be explained by cross-resistance of chemotherapy. We additionally found an association between ELAVL2 and CDKN1A, which may be regarded as the upstream and downstream factors that synergistically involved in the regulation of chemo-resistance in ESCC. Therefore, our study demonstrated that the genome-wide CRISPR activation library is a powerful strategy for the discovery of chemo-resistant genes critical for ESCC and we reported the first evidence that the ELAVL2-CDKN1A axis may be an important mechanism involved in chemo-resistance in ESCC."

Despite its widespread use, gemcitabine achieves responses in less than 10% of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer and has a very limited impact on overall survival due to intrinsic and acquired resistance. NUC-1031 (Acelarin), a phosphoramidate transformation of gemcitabine, was the first anti-cancer ProTide to enter the clinic. We find it displays important in vitro cytotoxicity differences to gemcitabine, and a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 genetic screening approach identified only the pyrimidine metabolism pathway as modifying cancer cell sensitivity to NUC-1031. Low deoxycytidine kinase expression in tumour biopsies from patients treated with gemcitabine, assessed by immunostaining and image analysis, correlates with a poor prognosis, but there is no such correlation in tumour biopsies from a Phase I cohort treated with NUC-1031."

The aim of the study was to utilize the whole human Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (GeCKO) library to screen for novel genes involved in cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cell lines. The GeCKO library targeted 19052 genes with 122417 unique guide sequences. Six candidate genes had been screened out including one previously validated gene SULF1 and five novel genes ZNF587B, TADA1, SEMA4G, POTEC and USP17L20. After validated by CCK-8 and RT-PCR analysis, two genes (ZNF587B and SULF1) were discovered to be involved in cisplatin resistance.

To identify potential therapeutic options for cancer patients with TP53 mutations, we profiled 127 FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs against human embryonic stem cells (hESC) in which we engineered TP53 deletion by genome editing. We identified 27 cancer therapeutic drugs for which TP53 mutations conferred resistance; most of these drugs target DNA synthesis or topoisomerase and cause DNA damage. We then performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen in the TP53-null hESC in the presence and absence of sublethal concentrations of cisplatin and identified 137 genes whose loss selectively resensitized the p53-null cells to this chemotherapeutic agent. Gene ontology classification of the resensitizing loci revealed significant overrepresentation of spindle checkpoint pathway genes. Moreover, we confirmed that targeting ZNF207/BuGZ sensitizes p53-null hESC to cisplatin. These data indicate that targeted inhibition of spindle assembly checkpoints (SAC) and chromosomal organizing centers may provide a way to treat p53-deficient cancer cells with standard chemotherapy drugs. Development of small-molecule inhibitors of SAC proteins may be a useful strategy for rescuing DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics in TP53-mutant cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that inhibition of spindle assembly checkpoints and chromosomal organizing centers may provide a new way to treat p53-deficient cancer cells with standard chemotherapy drugs."

        "Abstract": "Arsenic exposure is a worldwide health concern associated with an increased risk of skin, lung, and bladder cancer but arsenic trioxide (AsIII) is also an effective chemotherapeutic agent. The current use of AsIII in chemotherapy is limited to acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, AsIII was suggested as a potential therapy for other cancer types including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), especially when combined with other drugs. Here, we carried out a genome-wide CRISPR-based approach to identify modulators of AsIII toxicity in K562, a human CML cell line. We found that disruption of KEAP1, the inhibitory partner of the key antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2, or TXNDC17, a thioredoxin-like protein, markedly increased AsIII tolerance. Loss of the water channel AQP3, the zinc transporter ZNT1 and its regulator MTF1 also enhanced tolerance to AsIII whereas loss of the multidrug resistance protein ABCC1 increased sensitivity to AsIII. Remarkably, disruption of any of multiple genes, EEFSEC, SECISBP2, SEPHS2, SEPSECS, and PSTK, encoding proteins involved in selenocysteine metabolism increased resistance to AsIII. Our data suggest a model in which an intracellular interaction between selenium and AsIII may impact intracellular AsIII levels and toxicity. Together this work revealed a suite of cellular components/processes which modulate the toxicity of AsIII in CML cells. Targeting such processes simultaneously with AsIII treatment could potentiate AsIII in CML therapy."

        "Abstract": "Mutations in the ATM tumor suppressor gene confer hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents. To explore genetic resistance mechanisms, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens in cells treated with the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan. Thus, we here establish that inactivating terminal components of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) machinery or of the BRCA1-A complex specifically confer topotecan resistance to ATM-deficient cells. We show that hypersensitivity of ATM-mutant cells to topotecan or the poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib reflects delayed engagement of homologous recombination at DNA-replication-fork associated single-ended double-strand breaks (DSBs), allowing some to be subject to toxic NHEJ. Preventing DSB ligation by NHEJ, or enhancing homologous recombination by BRCA1-A complex disruption, suppresses this toxicity, highlighting a crucial role for ATM in preventing toxic LIG4-mediated chromosome fusions. Notably, suppressor mutations in ATM-mutant backgrounds are different to those in BRCA1-mutant scenarios, suggesting new opportunities for patient stratification and additional therapeutic vulnerabilities for clinical exploitation."

        "Abstract": "The response to first-line, platinum-based treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer has not improved in 3 decades. To identify genes that influence cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer. We performed a whole-genome CRISPR screen in a bladder cancer cell line to identify genes that mediate resistance to cisplatin. Targeted validation was performed in two bladder cancer cell lines. The top gene candidate was validated in a publicly available bladder cancer dataset. From the CRISPR screen, we identified MSH2 as the most significantly enriched gene and mismatch repair as the most significantly enriched pathway that promoted resistance to cisplatin. Bladder cancer cells with knockdown of MSH2 showed a reduction in cisplatin-mediated apoptosis. MSH2 loss did not impact the sensitivity to other chemotherapies, including the cisplatin analog oxaliplatin. Bladder tumors with low MSH2 protein levels, quantified using reverse-phase protein array, showed poorer survival when treated with cisplatin- or carboplatin-based therapy; these results require future validation using immunohistochemistry. Additionally, results are retrospective from patients with primarily high-grade tumors; thus, validation in a controlled clinical trial is needed. We generated in vitro evidence that bladder cancer cell lines depleted of MSH2 are more resistant to cisplatin. We additionally found an association between low MSH2 in bladder tumors and poorer patient survival when treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. If successfully validated prospectively, MSH2 protein level could assist in the selection of patients for chemotherapy. We report the first evidence that MSH2 protein level may contribute to chemotherapy resistance observed in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. MSH2 has potential as a biomarker predictive of response to platinum-based therapy."

        "Abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15% of lung cancers and is almost always linked to inactivating <i>RB1</i> and <i>TP53</i> mutations. SCLC frequently responds, albeit briefly, to chemotherapy. The canonical function of the <i>RB1</i> gene product RB1 is to repress the E2F transcription factor family. RB1 also plays both E2F-dependent and E2F-independent mitotic roles. We performed a synthetic lethal CRISPR/Cas9 screen in an <i>RB1</i> <sup>-/-</sup> SCLC cell line that conditionally expresses <i>RB1</i> to identify dependencies that are caused by RB1 loss and discovered that <i>RB1</i> <sup>-/-</sup> SCLC cell lines are hyperdependent on multiple proteins linked to chromosomal segregation, including Aurora B kinase. Moreover, we show that an Aurora B kinase inhibitor is efficacious in multiple preclinical SCLC models at concentrations that are well tolerated in mice. These results suggest that RB1 loss is a predictive biomarker for sensitivity to Aurora B kinase inhibitors in SCLC and perhaps other <i>RB1</i> <sup>-/-</sup> cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: SCLC is rarely associated with actionable protooncogene mutations. We did a CRISPR/Cas9-based screen that showed that <i>RB1</i> <sup>-/-</sup> SCLC are hyperdependent on <i>AURKB</i>, likely because both genes control mitotic fidelity, and confirmed that Aurora B kinase inhibitors are efficacious against <i>RB1</i> <sup>-/-</sup> SCLC tumors in mice at nontoxic doses.<i>See related commentary by Dick and Li, p. 169</i>.<i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 151</i>."

        "Abstract": "Although chemotherapy has significantly improved the prognosis of patients with cervical cancer, many patients exhibit selective responses to chemotherapy. This study aimed to identify genes associated with the sensitivity of cervical cancer cells to paclitaxel. SiHa cells were transfected with lentiCRISPR (genome-scale CRISPR knockout library v.2) and then treated with paclitaxel or vehicle for 14 days. Subsequently, we screened for candidate genes whose loss resulted in sensitivity to paclitaxel. We obtained 374 candidates, some of which were consistent with those reported in previous studies, including <i>ABCC9, IL37</i>, EIF3C, <i>AKT1S1</i>, and several members of the <i>PPP</i> gene family (PPP1R7, PPP2R5B, PPP1R7, and PPP1R11). Importantly, our findings highlighted the newly identified genes that could provide novel insights into the mechanisms of paclitaxel sensitivity in cervical cancer. Cas9 technology provides a reliable method for the exploration of more effective combination chemotherapies for patients at the gene level."

        "Abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can display de novo or acquired resistance to cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), a primary component of induction chemotherapy. To identify genes capable of independently imposing Ara-C resistance, we applied a genome-wide CRISPR library to human U937 cells and exposed to them to Ara-C. Interestingly, all drug resistant clones contained guide RNAs for DCK. To avoid DCK gene modification, gRNA resistant DCK cDNA was created by the introduction of silent mutations. The CRISPR screening was repeated using the gRNA resistant DCK, and loss of SLC29A was identified as also being capable of conveying Ara-C drug resistance. To determine if loss of Dck results in increased sensitivity to other drugs, we conducted a screen of 446 FDA approved drugs using two Dck-defective BXH-2 derived murine AML cell lines and their Ara-C sensitive parental lines. Both cell lines showed an increase in sensitivity to prednisolone. Guide RNA resistant cDNA rescue was a legitimate strategy and multiple DCK or SLC29A deficient human cell clones were established with one clone becoming prednisolone sensitive. Dck-defective leukemic cells may become prednisolone sensitive indicating prednisolone may be an effective adjuvant therapy in some cases of DCK-negative AML."
