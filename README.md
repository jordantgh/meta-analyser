## Long term

 - Get papers
 - Get supplements
 - Get the useful tables
    - What’s useful? Contiguous blocks & IFITM related (for now)
 - Group by treatment conditions
 - Get “averages” – standardisation first (Z scores)
 - (Potentially expand to other readouts later)
 - Exploratory analysis - discover novel factors?

## Short term

- Find one or two studies that have IFITM and make plots
   - Dry run of analysis methods
   - Progress!
